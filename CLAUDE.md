## Assessment

The goal of this project is to build two charts based on the following requirements. The chart type and design are up to you to choose and build as you see fit. Keep in mind that they should have good UI/UX for the type of data being displayed. Have fun and go wild.

The Base for this project will use Apex Charts. ( https://apexcharts.com/ ) You will need to install and run ApexCharts or use it through the CDN. Codepen or similar is fine.

First Chart:
The first chart is "New Users" over the last 10 days. Keep this in mind when building the first chart. Below is the data to use.

[3,5,1,0,2,7,1,9,13,3,5,6,1,0]

Second Chart:
The second chart will be "Users Gained/Lost" over the last 10 days. Below is the data to use.

[2,-3,5,1,-1,0,-2,4,1,-2,5,7,-3,0,1,-1]

Both charts should be contained within a responsive container that adheres to mobile-first principles. The header for the container should read "User Metrics". Have fun with this and make it yours. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
